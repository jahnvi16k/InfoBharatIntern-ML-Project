# Bike Rental Prediction using Machine Learning
This project was developed as part of the **Info Bharat Interns (NeuroNova)** internship. The goal is to predict bike rental counts based on weather and time-based features using machine learning.
## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To build a predictive model that accurately estimates the number of bike rentals based on features such as date, time, weather conditions, and holiday information.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Source:** [Bike Sharing Demand - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand)
- The dataset contains daily and hourly data on bike rentals.
- Key features:
  - `datetime`: Date and hour of the rental
  - `season`, `holiday`, `workingday`: Indicators for conditions
  - `weather`, `temp`, `atemp`, `humidity`, `windspeed`: Weather-related data
  - `casual`, `registered`, `count`: Rental counts
